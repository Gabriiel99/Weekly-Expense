# Weekly-Expense

When we enter the page it will ask us to enter our budget, this is a validation process in which we can only enter positive numbers. Then we will see a form where on the left we must enter the name and the amount of the expense (these fields are mandatory) and on the right the list with what we are entering which if we wish we can eliminate. We will also have the budget that we enter at the beginning and the remainder that according to the expense that we have, the table will change color, green to yellow reaching red if everything is spent.
